## Student Tests

Create student tests in files called `studentX.c` where `X` is a number pertaining to which test it is.

## discussion problems: `scanf() printf()`

Suppose we have these lines of code:

``` c
int x, u;
scanf("%d %d", &x, &y);
printf("x is %d, y is %d\n", x, y);
```
If we input these values, what would the output be?
```
2 3
```
* Output: 
  ```
  x is 2, y is 3
  ```

Input:
```
2 3 4
```
* Output: 
  ```
  x is 2, y is 3
  ```

Input: 
```
  3   4
```
* Output:
  ```
  x is 3, y is 4
  ```

Input:
```
23 456
```
* Output:
  ```
  x is 23, y is 456
  ```

Input: 
``` 
23Z 4
```
* Output:
  ```
  x is 23, y is 32746
  ```

Input:
```
