# Discussion 3 - 2/1/2023

## Intruduction

These are the notes I took during class

## Setting up emacs

if you've already taken CMSC216 before, then do this:

``` bash
grace9:~: mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.bak
grace9:~: mkdir ~/.emacs.d && touvh ~/.emacs.d/init.el

```

make sure you have the `.emacs` file in your home directory by running this command

``` bash
grace9:~: cat .emacs
```

In this command, `cat` is a tool whicih prints the entire file to the CLI. 

if you get an error that "there is no such file or directory", then run this command:

``` bash
grace90:~: touch .emacs
```

open up the `.emacs` file in your favorite Unix file editor. For example, to open the file in emacs, run 

``` bash
grace9:~: emacs .emacs &
```

for vim, run
``` bash
grace9:~: vim .emacs &
```

at the bottom of the file (if there is one), write:

``` emacs lisp
(load "/afs/glue/class/spring2023/cmsc/216/0101/public/.216.elc" nil t)
```

open this file:

``` bash
grace9:~: emacs ~/.path &
```

to get the `216public` folder in your home directory, create a link:

``` bash
ln -s /afs/glue/class/spring2023/cmsc/216/0101/public ~/216public
```

to get your own `216` folder in your home directory, create this link:

``` bash
grace9:~: ln -s /afs/glue/class/spring2023/cmsc/216/0101/student/<your directoryID> ~/216
```

Then, open `.cshrc.mine` in emacs or something
```
grace9:~: emacs -nw ~/.cshrc.mine
```

and put this line at the end of the file:

```
source ~/216public/.216
```
